        <h2 class="paragraph_title"> Welcome to the Freezer</h2>
        <p>
          Seattle is known for many things, Pikes Place Market, the Seahawks, and picturesque views of Rainier and the Puget Sound, but Seattle is also home of the infamous Seattle Freeze. The Seattle Freeze refers to a belief that it is especially difficult to make new friends in the city of Seattle, particularly for immigrants from other cities. There are many plausible reasons for this distance between locals and newbies; Washington Residents ranked 48th in extroversion (Persepctives on Psychological Science, 2008), and the booming job market has caused a surge of young workers who live and socialize in cliques. HOWEVER, this is not an unsermountable problem. We can thaw the Seattle freeze through our warming events and adopt a friend profiles.
